ArrayMerger program, made by Levi Olson. This was made for school, the instructions were provided by Edhesive. The instructions are as follows (in my own words):
	The user will enter a the length of an array, it must be greater than or equal to 10. The program will then generate 2 arrays of ints all greater than or equal 1 and lesser than or equal to 100. The length of these arrays will be the length that the user enters. The program will then generate an array that is the 2 arrays combined but without any dupelicates (so every value in this new array is unique). It will be organized so that the first element is the first one from the first array, and then the first one from the second, then the second from the first, then the second from the second, and so on until every value from the 2 arrays has been added (but any dupelicates are not added). The program will then display for the user the 2 original arrays and the array created from them.
